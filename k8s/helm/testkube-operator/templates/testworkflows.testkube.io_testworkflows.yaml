                                      operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                                      When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                                      (which defaults to None).

                                      RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                      recursively.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                  RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                  recursively.

                                  If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                  If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                  recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                  recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                  field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                  supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                  an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                  If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                  None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                  If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.

                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                  a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                  Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                  If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                  value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                  Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                  the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                  This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                  Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                          It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                          Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                          "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                          This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                          "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                          This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                          It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                          Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                          whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                          CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                          "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                          and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                          This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                          All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                          specified.
                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                          in any namespaces.

                                seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                  field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                  supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                  an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                    recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                    recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                    field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                    supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                    an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                    If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                    None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                    If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                  any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,

                                  "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
