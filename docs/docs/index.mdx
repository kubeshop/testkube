# Testkube Documentation
Welcome to our documentation! 
This is the place where you'll find everything you need to get ramped up and start testing with Testkube.

## What is Testkube?

Testkube is a Kubernetes-native testing framework for Testers, Developers, and DevOps practitioners that allows you to automate the executions of your existing testing tools inside your Kubernetes cluster, removing all the complexity from your CI/CD pipelines.

## Try it out

export const DocCardList = (input) => (
    <section className={clsx("row")}>
        {[
            {
                icon: "🚀",
                label: "Getting Started",
                description: "Get up and running by installing the Testkube CLI and its components within minutes! ",
                href: "/getting-started",
                type: "intro",
            },
            {
                icon: "🏎💨",
                label: "Run your first test",
                description: "Learn how to create, run, and display the results for your first test.",
                href: "/getting-started/step3-creating-first-test",
                type: "intro",
            },
            {
                icon: "🛠",
                label: "Set up your workflow",
                description: "Our guides will walk you through incorporating Testkube into your environment, with the tools you already use.",
                href: "/guides/exposing-testkube/overview",
                type: "intro",
            },
        ].map((item, i) => (
            <article key={i} className="col nopadding intro__card">
                <DocCard item={item} />
            </article>
        ))}
    </section>
);

<DocCardList />

## Advantages of using Testkube

With Testkube, tests are part of a cluster's state and can be executed as needed:

- ✨Automatically on deployment of annotated/labeled Kubernetes objects (services, pods, etc)
- ⏲️ On a schedule
- 🧑‍💻 Manually via Testkube's CLI or Open Source Dashboard
- ⚡ Externally triggered via API
