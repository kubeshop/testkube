# Testkube Quickstart

Following this quickstart tutorial provides you with a simplified On Prem installation that deploys both the control plane and agent within the same namespace. It comes with a preconfigured admin, organisation and environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can get started with our quickstart deployment you must install:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster - If you don't have one [Evaluating Testkube without access to Kubernetes](quickstart-no-k8s.mdx)
- [The helm CLI][install-helm] to generate the Kubernetes YAML configuration.
- [The kubectl CLI][install-kubectl] to run commands against Kubernetes clusters
- The Testkube CLI for the quickstarter. For instructions, see the next section.

For the complete Testkube experience including the Dashboard and all related functionality you will need to [request your free trial license](https://testkube.io/download) that will be needed during the installation process. Alternatively, you can get started with just [the standalone agent][install-oss] which is fully open-sourced and does not require a license.

:::info
Why is a license is required? Obtaining a free license helps us ensure you have an optimal installation and product experience with Testkube. Don’t worry - you won’t have to talk to a sales rep or enter any credit-card details to get going - but if you need our help we’ll be much better prepared!

## Install the Testkube CLI

You can choose one of the following methods to install the CLI:

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
choco source add --name=kubeshop_repo --source=https://chocolatey.kubeshop.io/chocolatey
choco install testkube -y
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

To install Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

```sh
wget -qO - https://repo.testkube.io/key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repo.testkube.io/linux linux main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y testkube
```

To install Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

```bash
curl -sSLf https://get.testkube.io | sh
```

<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual Download">

To install Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

1. Download the binary for the version and platform of your choice [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/releases).
2. Unpack it. For example, in Linux use `tar -zxvf testkube_1.5.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`.
3. Move it to a location in the PATH. For example:

```sh
mv  testkube_1.5.1_Linux_x86_64/kubectl-testkube /usr/local/bin/kubectl-testkube
```

For Windows, you will need to unpack the binary and add it to the `%PATH%` as well.

If you use a package manager that we don\'t support, please let us know here [#161](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/issues/161).

## Run the Testkube Installer

The installer will complete these steps:

- Check if you have chosen the right Kubernetes environment.
- Ask for some information, such as the previously requested license.
- Install Testkube’s control plane and agent, both within the same namespace.

The whole process takes 3-5 minutes and can be started with the following command:

```bash
testkube init demo
```

Once installed, you will be asked if you want to `testkube dashboard` to conveniently access all relevant services on your localhost. You can always execute this yourself afterwards should you close this terminal after installation. The admin in this demo has the following e-mail and password: `admin@example.com/password`.

Happy testing!
