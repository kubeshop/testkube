## Testkube 2.6.2

This patch release includes critical bug fixes for utilization metrics and MinIO storage configuration.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Panic on Nil Timestamp in Utilization Metrics Grouping** ([#7057](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/pull/7057))
  
  Fixed a critical panic that occurred when processing utilization metrics with nil timestamps.
  
  **Root Cause:**
  - The `groupDataPoints` function in `pkg/utilization/core/group.go` attempted to dereference `metric.Timestamp` without checking if it was nil
  - This caused a nil pointer dereference panic when metrics without timestamps were processed
  
  **Solution:**
  - Added nil check for `metric.Timestamp` before processing
  - Metrics without timestamps are now safely skipped during grouping
  - Added comprehensive test coverage with test data file `metrics_no_timestamp.influx`
  
  **Impact:**
  - Prevents agent crashes when processing incomplete metric data
  - Improves system stability and reliability

* **MinIO Client Certificate Loading with Empty Paths** ([#7045](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/pull/7045))
  
  Fixed an issue where MinIO client initialization failed when using GCS S3-compatible endpoints with SSL enabled but without client certificates.
  
  **Root Cause:**
  - The `GetTLSOptions` function in `pkg/storage/minio/helpers.go` unconditionally attempted to load client certificates
  - When `certFile` or `keyFile` were empty strings (common for GCS and other S3-compatible services), MinIO client initialization would fail
  - GCS S3-compatible endpoints require SSL but don't use client certificate authentication
  
  **Solution:**
  - Added validation to only load client certificates when both `certFile` and `keyFile` are non-empty
  - Server CA certificates (via `caFile`) are still loaded when provided, independent of client certificates
  - Added comprehensive test suite covering all TLS configuration scenarios:
    - SSL with client certificates
    - SSL without client certificates (GCS use case)
    - SSL with CA file only
    - Insecure mode
    - No SSL
  
  **Impact:**
  - Enables proper use of GCS S3-compatible storage endpoints
  - Fixes artifact storage configuration for Google Cloud Storage users
  - Improves compatibility with various S3-compatible storage providers
