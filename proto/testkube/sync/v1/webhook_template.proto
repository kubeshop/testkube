  // The rationale for this lazy implementation is that creating
  // a protobuf implementation of CRD data structures is both
  // time consuming, and similarly capable of causing incompatibilities
  // between the protobuf and CRD implementations. As a result this
  // loose data format will be used until CRD definition is moved
  // to a single source from which all required usages can be
  // automatically generated to ensure compatibility.
