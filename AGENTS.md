# Working with Testkube Core (testkube)

## Purpose

- Implements the Testkube agent services that run inside clusters.
- Provides the Testkube CLI (`kubectl-testkube`) for interacting with Testkube.
- Exposes shared primitives and client structs for downstream tooling.
- Defines the agent OpenAPI contract in `api/v1/testkube.yaml`.

## Entry points

- `cmd/api-server` is the main agent API server; agent personas (superagent, runner, listener, GitOps, etc.) are enabled through Helm values and env configuration.
- `cmd/kubectl-testkube` is the Testkube CLI for managing tests, workflows, and interacting with Testkube installations.
- `cmd/testworkflow-init` initializes TestWorkflow execution containers and orchestrates workflow step groups.
- `cmd/testworkflow-toolkit` provides runtime utilities and commands for TestWorkflow containers (artifacts, services, parallel execution, etc.).
- `cmd/tcl/devbox-mutating-webhook` is a Kubernetes mutating webhook for injecting devbox containers into pods.
- `cmd/tcl/devbox-binary-storage` serves as a binary storage server for devbox dependencies and cached files.
- `cmd/debug-server` is a simple HTTP server that dumps incoming requests for debugging purposes.
- `cmd/proxy` proxies HTTP requests to the Testkube API server for local development and debugging.
- `cmd/choco-stub` displays a deprecation message for the old Chocolatey package location.
- `cmd/tools` contains internal tooling for release management and version bumping.

## Regenerating artifacts

- Update the agent OpenAPI files with `make generate-openapi` after schema edits.
- Regenerate SQL code when query files change via `make generate-sqlc`.
- Refresh mocks for new or updated interfaces using `make generate-mocks`.

## Configuration references

- Agent behavior is driven by env vars defined in `internal/config/config.go` (scan for `envconfig:"..."` tags when researching a toggle).
- Helm chart values are the source of deployment defaults; `build/_local/values.dev.yaml` (shaped by the `values.dev.tpl.yaml` template) shows the local overrides used by `tk-dev` if you need a concrete reference.

## Tips

- Review the Makefile for additional helper targets when unfamiliar tasks come up.
