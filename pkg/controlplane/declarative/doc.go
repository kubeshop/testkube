// Package declarative holds the rules for Control Plane resources: entities
// that live only in the Control Plane (Insights boards first; AI agents and
// test bundles later) declared in CRD-shaped YAML. Each entity family has an
// API group and a schema package of its own: insights.testkube.io
// (api/insights/v1alpha1) for boards, with ai.testkube.io and
// testbundles.testkube.io to come. Shared status types are in api/common/v1.
//
// It is a contract between three consumers, which must all go through it
// rather than reimplement it:
//
//   - the CLI (testkube apply/get/delete), which validates locally before it
//     sends anything;
//   - the GitOps agent, which syncs the same objects as custom resources;
//   - the Control Plane (testkube-cloud-api internal/declarative), which
//     validates and normalizes every PUT with Normalize, and maps an object
//     to and from its stored form (BoardToStored, BoardFromStored).
//
// A disagreement between them would make an object the CLI accepts fail in
// the Control Plane, or make an export fail to re-apply.
//
// # Registry
//
// Kinds lists every supported kind with its plural resource name (the path
// segment of the generic endpoints), its CLI names and its scope. Decode reads
// multi-document YAML and dispatches each document on apiVersion and kind.
//
// # Normalization
//
// Normalize validates an object and fills in its defaults, in place. It is
// idempotent - normalizing a normalized object changes nothing - which is what
// lets an exported object be re-applied without a diff. Generated values are
// deterministic for the same reason: a report filter without an id gets
// <report id>-<index>, never a random one.
//
// # Wire format
//
// The client package talks to the Control Plane's generic, name-keyed
// endpoints:
//
//	GET|PUT|DELETE /organizations/{org}[/environments/{env}]/resources/{resource}/{name}
//	GET            /organizations/{org}[/environments/{env}]/resources/{resource}
//
// The environment segment is present only for environment-scoped kinds. PUT
// takes the object as JSON, stripped by PrepareForApply, and returns it as
// stored. GET returns the object with status filled in, and the list returns
// every object of the kind as {"elements": [...]}, the Control Plane's list
// envelope (it pages only when asked to). Status, and with it GitOps ownership, is never taken from
// a request body.
